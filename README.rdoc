== Getting Started

0. I assume you already have ruby 1.9 and rubygems

1. Get MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/Quickstart) and run it:
    mongod

2. Install bundler:
    gem install bundler

3. (optional for rbenv) rehash rbenv binaries:
    rbenv rehash

4. Bundle the gems:
    bundle install

5. Run the specs (optional):
    bundle exec rspec spec

6. Start the server:
    bundle exec rails server

7. Point your browser to:
    http://localhost:3000


== Notes

* Very early in development, <b>might eat your cat</b>.

* Has no access control yet.  *Anyone* can do *anything*.

* The database it uses is named +sushi_+ + +production/development/test+ for no
  apparent reason.

* This web app is supposed to look good and be usable on *Desktops* (large
  screens), *Laptops* (med-sized screens), *Tablets* (small screens) and
  *Smartphones* (tiny screens)

* It _should_ be deployable on Heroku.

== Demo

* http://dnd-onrails-demo.herokuapp.com on Heroku (be gentle)

== Status

=== Fully Working

* Combat initiative table

=== Partially Working

* NPCs (no powers)
* Encounters
